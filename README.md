# Mohr's_Circle

It is a simple program using Python, NumPy and Matplotlib which helps a user to plot Mohr's Cirle when given the two-dimensional state of stress.
# Introduction
In Mechanics, the mechanics of deformable bodies is termed as Strength of Materials, Mechanics of Materials, or in its more advanced form, as Solid Mechanics. Mechanics of Materials deals with stresses, in their simple one-dimensional states, or at a slightly advanced level, a two-dimensional state of stress; a general three-dimensional state of stress is also possible, and involves advanced mathematical methods for its analysis.
